# 🛡️ Visitor Risk Scoring Engine

A **production-ready Spring Boot backend system** for evaluating visitor risk using configurable rules, secure authentication, and role-based authorization.

---

## 🌐 Live Deployment

The application is deployed on **Render** and backed by **PostgreSQL**.

🔗 **Swagger UI**: https://visitor-risk-score-engine-project.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html

## 📌 Overview

The **Visitor Risk Scoring Engine** helps organizations **assess and manage visitor risk in a structured, rule-driven manner**.

Instead of relying on subjective judgment, the system evaluates visitors based on:
- **Admin-defined risk rules**
- **Recorded visitor activity and visit logs**

Each visitor is assigned a **cumulative risk score**, enabling informed decisions and consistent enforcement of security policies.

The system uses **JWT-based authentication** and **role-based authorization** to ensure secure access to critical operations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a **clean layered architecture**:

```

Controller  →  Service  →  Repository  →  Database
↓
Security (JWT, Roles)

````

### Layers

- **Controller Layer** – Handles HTTP requests and responses  
- **Service Layer** – Business logic and validations  
- **Repository Layer** – Database access using JPA  
- **Security Layer** – JWT validation and role-based authorization  

---

## 🔐 Security Design

- Users authenticate via login to receive a **JWT token**
- The token contains:
  - User ID
  - Email
  - Assigned roles (ADMIN / STAFF)
- A custom **JWT Authentication Filter** validates the token on every request
- Access control is enforced using **`@PreAuthorize` annotations**

Example:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@PostMapping("/risk-rules")
public RiskRule createRule(...) { }
````

| Role  | Permissions                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| ADMIN | Create, update, and delete risk rules |
| STAFF | Add visitor profiles and visit logs   |
| BOTH  | View permitted resources              |
